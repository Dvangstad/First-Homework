# First-Homework
My first homework assignment
I had to restructure the code to make it more assesable to users.
I learned to use semantic html tags to provide structure to the code.
I put the heading attributes into sequential order.
I made sure there was a precise title in the title element.
I used alt attributes for all the image elements.
